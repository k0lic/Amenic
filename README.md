# Project description
Amenic is an online platform dedicated to making the entire process of booking a movie ticket as seamless, and easy, as possible.

# Types of users
## Registered user
A registered user has the same functionality as a guest, in addition to being able to make a reservation for a movie ticket.

## Cinemas
This account is meant for actual cinemas, and it's managed by people at the cinema. Cinema accounts can post movie screenings, alter their own page, manage reservations and much more.

## Workers
Each cinema that uses Amenic as their booking system can grant their workers functionality such as managing movie screenings and reservations.

## Admins
The Admin team consists of technically skilled people who operate directly on the system, update it and make essential changes. Admins have the ability to approve new cinemas, and manage other users.

# Features
* Users can search for a specific movie or cinema, and make a reservation for a specific screening
* Cinema accounts can manage all aspects of their account on the platform. This includes movie screenings, how other users see their page, what's screening soon, etc.
* Worker accounts can manage screenings and reservations

# Tech
The entire platform is supposed to be built on PHP and Laravel, with the Blade templating engine for the front-end portion. This may change, and the team might decide to go with something more powerful, like React.JS / Vue.JS.

As for the data, it will be stored in a MySQL database and accessed from Laravel.

Apart from the mentioned technologies, the platform also uses a couple of APIs to manage movie data and images.

# Quality of service
We believe great software requires time, energy and attention to even the smallest details. That's why we test all of our features separately, and make sure they work across a wide range of devices.

Security is another big focus. While dealing with sensitive information, like email addresses and passwords, it's easy to make mistakes. We strive to implement the best security practices when dealing with user data. All of the information we store is encrypted on our servers, and users can access or delete their data at any time.

# Future plans
This is a sneak peak at possible upcoming features:
* A notification / message system on the platform, so users can interact with their cinemas and be notified of any changes, or new promotions
* We plan to support indie movie cinemas, not just the big players. This way, even people who are screening a movie from their garage can have a shot at gathering people
* Enable online payment for movie tickets. Nobody likes to deal in physical cash, that's why we want to partner with services like Stripe, to provide our users with the ability to pay for their movie tickets - right from the browser
